# MigrateBigDataPresentation

This repository contains the original work of Julie McLain-Harper.  The files are intended to supplement the discussion 
of my presentation "Migrate Transactional Big Data."  This code can be implemented in a SQL Server environment that
utilizes SQL Server Enterprise Edition, and has the SQL Agent service running.
